Using the [`Flexdashboard`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html) package I created a template to produce dashboards from Reddit `/r/rugbyunion` Match Thread comments and match data scraped from the official RWC site. 

For more information on the analysis which underpins the graphics on the dashboards see [this article](wc19_final_mt.html)

*N.B. Due to changes to Google Natural Language API the sentiment scores shown may not be exactly reproducible at any given time.*
